            <strong><pre>Royal Never Give Up is a Chinese team, formed by the Royal Club organization after Star Horn Royal Club's relegation from the LPL.

            After a 1st-place finish at NESO 2015, RNG finalized a 10-player roster by adding Sask, SHRC and King alumni InSec and NaMei, and two starters from Samsung Galaxy White's Season 4 World Champions - support Mata from Vici Gaming and top-laner Looper from Masters 3. The team impressed early in LPL play, winning consecutive series against Vici and group top seed EDward Gaming. A continued strong performance, including dealing the Qiao Gu Reapers their first series loss of the split, earned an invite to the IEM Season X World Championship in Katowice, Royal's first international tournament in the RNG incarnation. They defeated Origen and Ever to win their group but lost to Fnatic largely in part due to Rekkles' MVP-level performance, primarily as Jhin.

            RNG gave playing time to their other five members after IEM Katowice, including InSec picking Master Yi in a comeback win against Energy Pacemaker.All and NaMei marking his return to form by getting a pentakill playing Lucian against Vici. Finishing first in Group B, they earned a bye into the semifinals and then defeated Team WE 3-2 and EDG 3-1 to become LPL champions and earn the right to represent China on home soil at the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational in Shanghai. It marked not only RNG's first LPL championship but also the first for any Royal Club team (including the original Royal Club, Star Horn Royal, and Team King.)

            RNG proceeded to impress at MSI, going undefeated over the first three days of group stage play, defeating G2 Esports, Counter Logic Gaming, Flash Wolves, SuperMassive eSports, and even defending world champions and tournament favorites SK Telecom T1. Their first defeat came at the hands of the North American CLG with a massive comeback win, but they still secured the top seed into the playoffs - and a World Championship Pool 1 seed for China. Unfortunately for RNG, SK Telecom T1 recovered from a disappointing fourth place group stage finish, and RNG lost 3-1 in the semifinals - including a perfect game 4 from the Korean team.

            Following MSI, InSec, LetMe and Ley stepped down from RNG to focus on the SHRC LSPL squad, but the team acquired former EDG manager San Shao and re-acquired AD Carry Uzi, who had played on Royal's 2013 team and SHRC's 2014 team - both of which had finished second at Worlds. The team was placed in Group B for the Summer Season and ended the Regular Season in first place, with a positive record against all other teams except EDward Gaming. These results, however, do not show the drop in performance that the team suffered, with support player Mata in particular having a rough split and the new superstar botlane playing out of sync, with a conflict between Uzi's patented lane aggressiveness and Mata's roaming tendencies.

            Coming into the Semifinals of the Summer Playoffs, Royal faced and bested Team WE in a close 3-2 series. They thus advanced to the Finals, where EDward Gaming waited for them after completing their perfect split run. The Spring Split Finals repeat ended with EDG trumping over Royal 0-3 and exposing the team's struggles, as they were consistently outpaced on a macro level by their rivals. With EDG autoqualifying to the 2016 Season World Championship Royal qualified as the second Chinese seed due to having the most Championship Points.

            Royal was placed in Group D alongside NALCS' Team SoloMid, LCK's Samsung Galaxy and EULCS' Splyce. The team lived up to their image of a team composed of highly-talented individuals with an heavy botlane carry focus and glaring problems in the macro game after the laning phase ends; they still managed to brute force their way through the Group Stage with an overall 3-3 score, with two wins against TSM granting them the upper hand in the head-to-head matchup for the second place tiebreaker. They then met SK Telecom T1 in the Quarterfinals: even though they secured Game 1, the Chinese team was eliminated from contention as the Korean powerhouse closed out the series 1-3 and advanced to the Semifinals.
