            <p>IG managed to retain their entire roster from 2018 going into the 2019 season. IG started off their season by winning the 2018 Demacia Cup Winter by defeating Topsports Gaming 3-1 in the finals. IG finished the 2019 Spring Split regular season in 2nd place with a 11-4 record, acquiring a bye to the semifinals. IG went on to face Topsports Gaming in the semifinals of playoffs, beating them 3-1 and advancing to the finals. In the finals, they faced 8th seed JD Gaming, who made a miracle run to the finals. Invictus Gaming destroyed JD Gaming in the finals of the 2019 LPL Spring Split with an astounding 3-0 stomp, breaking the record of fastest LPL final in history with only 86 minutes played, acquiring their first LPL title since the organization was formed and a spot at the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational.</p>
        
            <p>IG continued its winning streak by going 9-0 to start the 2019 MSI Main Event before SK Telecom T1 defeated them to conclude the group stage. After selecting Team Liquid as their opponent for the playoffs, Invictus dropped the first two games despite holding over five thousand gold leads in both matches. IG was able to take game three, but could not turn around the series as the tournament favorites fell in four games, 1-3.</p>

            <p>IG's shocking loss to Team Liquid left the team in shambles, with Baolan being subbed out for the first two weeks of the summer split in favor of their rookie LDL support, Lucas. Rookie was forced to step away for a while as well, with Forge taking his place. IG managed to qualify for playoffs, finishing the regular season in 6th place. In the first round of playoffs, IG faced off against LNG Esports. Many expected IG to take the series, but instead, LNG destroyed IG in a 3-0 stomp. This would mean that IG would have to win the LPL 2019 Regional Finals in order to qualify for Worlds. In the first round of the gauntlet, IG managed to take down JD Gaming in a 5 game series. In the final of the LPL gauntlet, Invictus faced off against Top Esports. The series went back and forth, but in the end, Invictus managed to take the victory in game 5 and qualify for the 2019 World Championship as the third seed from the LPL.</p>

            <p>At the World Championship, Invictus would be drawn into Group D, alongside DAMWON Gaming, Team Liquid and Ahq eSports Club. IG finished the group stage with a 4-2 record, only dropping their two games to DAMWON. IG qualified for the knockout stage of Worlds 2019. In the quarterfinals, Invictus Gaming would meet the LCK's 2nd seed Griffin. Invictus were seen as the underdogs in the series, but they came storming out the gate, winning the first two games of the series to take a 2-0 lead. Griffin managed to fight back and take game 3, but it was all for nor, as IG stomped Griffin in game 4 to advance to the semifinals. In the semifinals, Invictus Gaming met fellow Chinese team FunPlus Phoenix. IG yet again entered the series as underdogs and lost Game 1 of the series. They managed to tie up the series in a nail-biter game 2, but fell behind 1-2 after losing Game 3. In the fourth game, IG managed to build up an advantage and lead in the late game, but failed to execute properly and were eliminated from the 2019 World Championship by FunPlus Phoenix, who would go on to win the finals and become World Champions.</p>
